  Why players will need this ?
</h2>
Nowadays, not only kids but adults play a game for release their stress. As the market demands is booming, huge number of games are published from not only well-known company but also personal developer. Since there are too many games in the markets it is almost impossible for people to buy a game which suits for his or her flavor. There is no way to figure out that a game is interesting before purchasing it. Usually, people buy a game made by huge company like “Blizzard” and play a couple of times and make a decision to keep it or return it. in this process they could not return a game or overlook a game which is comparable to or better then corporation’s one but made by a person. It makes people to spend a lot of money and time. The Game Recommender can get rid of this unnecessary process to make better gaming life.
